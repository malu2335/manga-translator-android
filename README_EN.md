# Manga Translator 📖

[中文](./README.md) | English

An Android manga translation app with local speech bubble detection and OCR, combined with an OpenAI-compatible API for translation. Translated text is rendered back onto the original image as draggable text bubbles. It also supports screen translation with a floating overlay, so you can recognize and translate manga text directly from any app or from the home screen.

## Key Features ✨
- Translate Japanese, English, Korean, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian and more into Chinese, or translate Chinese into English/Russian
- Screen translation: supports floating-window translation to recognize and translate manga text from any screen
- Manga library management: create folders, import images in batch, import manga folders, and support CBZ, ZIP, and PDF import/export
- Translation pipeline: speech bubble detection + local or OpenAI-compatible API OCR + LLM translation, with both standard mode and full-text fast translation
- Reading experience: translation overlay, draggable translated bubbles, and automatic reading progress saving; new cancel button and +/- fine-tune controls, synchronized zoom between webtoon and normal reading
- Font settings: custom bubble fonts and bold style are supported; normal bubbles and floating-window bubbles share the same font configuration
- Glossary and cache: maintain `glossary.json` per folder and automatically accumulate consistent name translations
- Background translation notification: sends an audible high-priority system notification when folder/batch translation finishes; tapping it returns to the library
- Updates and logs: check for updates on launch, foreground service during translation, and in-app log viewing
- Webtoon/long-image support: automatically detect whether a work is closer to webtoon layout and switch reading mode; cross-page bubble merging is supported in webtoon/long-image mode

## Supported Translation Languages 🌐
- Target language is determined by the app UI language:
  - Simplified Chinese UI -> Simplified Chinese
  - Traditional Chinese UI -> Traditional Chinese
  - English UI -> English
  - Russian UI -> Russian
  - Brazilian Portuguese UI -> Brazilian Portuguese
- Source language for each folder can be set independently in the library and supports: Japanese, English, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Chinese-English mixed, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian
- When the app UI is switched to Traditional Chinese, it will prioritize Traditional Chinese prompts

## Quick Start 🚀
1. Create a folder in the manga library and import images
2. Make sure image filenames match the reading order, such as `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`
3. In Settings > OCR Settings, choose local OCR or enter the URL, key, and model for an OpenAI-compatible OCR API
4. Return to the library, choose a folder, and tap "Translate Folder"
5. After translation finishes, tap "Start Reading" and drag bubble positions on the reader page as needed

*For full-text fast translation, it is recommended to upload and translate in batches for large folders, or increase the API timeout in Settings.*

## FAQ ❓
- Translation fails or returns empty results: make sure the API URL is the OpenAI-compatible base URL provided by the service (for example, `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` or `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4`); the app will auto-append `/chat/completions`. The model name must match the provider and the network must be reachable
- Translation order is incorrect: rename images first so they match the reading order
- How do I get an AI API: please search for a suitable provider based on your needs

## Data and File Layout 🗂️
- Manga library storage: `/Android/data/<package>/files/manga_library/`
- Each image generates a same-name `*.json` translation result, and OCR cache is stored as `*.ocr.json`
- Glossary: each folder maintains its own `glossary.json`
- Reading progress, full-text fast translation switches, and related settings are stored in SharedPreferences
